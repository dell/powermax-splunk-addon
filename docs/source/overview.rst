About the PowerMax for Splunk Add-on and App
--------------------------------------------
PowerMax for Splunk provides Splunk users with a backend Technology Add-on (TA)
and frontend app to simplify interaction with Splunk Enterprise environments.

The Splunk Technology Add-on for PowerMax allows a Splunk Enterprise
administrator to collect inventory, performance information, alert, and audit
log information from VMAX/PowerMax storage arrays. The TA is a wrapper
around the opensource library PyU4V_, providing programmatic access to the
Unisphere for PowerMax REST API.  You can directly analyse data use it as a
contextual data feed to correlate with other operational or security data in
Splunk Enterprise.

The Splunk App for Dell EMC PowerMax allows a Splunk Enterprise administrator
to data from PowerMax arrays through the TA and present them in pre-built
dashboards, tables, and time charts for in-depth analysis.

The TA and App can be downloaded from the links below:
