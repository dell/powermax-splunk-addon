Issues & Support
================

We greatly value your feedback! Please file bugs and issues on the GitHub
issues_ page for this project.

We aim to track and document everything related to this repo via the issues
page. The code and documentation are released with no warranties or SLAs and
are intended to be supported through a community driven process.

When opening an issue please include the following information to help us
debug:

- PyU4V version
- Unisphere version
- Description of the problem
- Impacted functions
- PyU4V logs showing issue

.. note::
    We will support N-2 releases from the current master release which includes
    bug and security fixes. If an issue appears in a code base older than N-2
    we will try to assist as best possible but ultimately upgrading to a newer
    version of PyU4V will be the ideal outcome. As new releases of PyU4V are
    made available, anything older than N-2 will be marked as End of Life
    (EOL).
